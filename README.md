# Fan_Controller_System
# Temperature-Controlled Fan Controller System  A project to design a temperature-controlled fan using an ATmega32 microcontroller. The fan automatically adjusts its speed based on the temperature sensed by an LM35 sensor. The system displays the current temperature and fan state on a 2x16 LCD and uses PWM for motor speed control.
